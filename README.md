## **Dataset Overview**
The dataset includes the following attributes:

| Attribute          | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Car Name**       | The make and model of the car.                                             |
| **Year**           | The year of manufacture.                                                   |
| **Selling Price**  | The price at which the car is being sold (in currency).                    |
| **Present Price**  | The current showroom price of the car (in currency).                       |
| **Kilometers Driven** | The total kilometers the car has been driven.                             |
| **Fuel Type**      | Type of fuel used (e.g., Petrol, Diesel, CNG).                             |
| **Seller Type**    | Whether the seller is a dealer or an individual.                           |
| **Transmission Type** | Indicates whether the car has a manual or automatic transmission.         |
| **Previous Owners**| The number of previous owners of the car.                                  |
